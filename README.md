A lightweight, high-performance MQTT broker built in Rust, designed for reliability and scalability. AxonMQ is suitable for a wide range of applications, from IoT data collection to real-time messaging.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support**: MQTT v3.1.1 and v5.0 over TCP, TLS, WebSocket (WS), and Secure WebSocket (WSS).
- **High Performance**: Built on Tokio, leveraging Rust's performance and safety features for low-latency, high-throughput message delivery.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource footprint, capable of starting with as little as 5MB of memory. Designed with environmental goals in mind, it aims to use fewer resources, consume less power, and emit less CO2.
- **Configurable**: Easily configure listeners, TLS settings, and other parameters via a simple `config.toml` file.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compiles and runs on major platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### 0. Download from Releases

Pre-built packages for various platforms are available on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/letoille/AxonMQ/releases). You can download `.deb` (for Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` (for Rocky Linux/Centos), and `.zip` (for Windows) packages directly.

#### 1. Build from Source

Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letoille/AxonMQ.git
cd AxonMQ
cargo build --release
```

#### 2. Configure AxonMQ

Edit the `config.toml` file to set up your desired listeners. By default, listeners are bound to `127.0.0.1`. If you need to access the broker from other machines, change `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` (to bind to all available network interfaces) or a specific IP address. For local testing, the default `127.0.0.1` is sufficient.

#### 3. Run the Broker

```bash
./target/release/axonmq
```

The broker will start and log its status to the console.

### üîí Security Note: TLS Certificates

**Warning:** The certificates included in the `certs` directory are for demonstration and testing purposes only. They are insecure and **must not** be used in a production environment.

For any real deployment, you should replace `certs/server.crt` and `certs/server.key` with your own certificates.

- **For Production**: It is highly recommended to use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- **For Development/Testing**: If you need to generate a new self-signed certificate, you can use the following `openssl` command. This is more secure than using the default, publicly known certificate.

```bash
# Generate a new private key and self-signed certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 3650 -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
This command creates a certificate valid for 10 years for the domain `localhost`. Your MQTT clients will still need to be configured to trust this self-signed certificate.

### üí° Future Plans

We are continuously working to enhance AxonMQ. Here are some key features planned for future releases:

- **Deep Sparkplug B Integration**: Comprehensive support for Sparkplug B specification, including advanced state management and device lifecycle.
- **Cluster Deployment Support**: Enable high-availability and horizontal scalability through cluster deployment capabilities.
- **Web-based Management Console**: A user-friendly web interface for monitoring, managing, and configuring the AxonMQ broker.
- **Access Control List (ACL) Support**: Implement robust ACLs to manage client permissions for publishing and subscribing to topics.
- **Disk-based Persistence**: Implement robust persistence for messages and client sessions to ensure data integrity across broker restarts.
- **Advanced Authentication**: Support for client certificate authentication, LDAP, OAuth/JWT, and other external authentication mechanisms.
- **Broker Bridging/Federation**: Allow connecting multiple AxonMQ instances or bridging to other MQTT brokers for distributed deployments.
- **Metrics & Monitoring Integration**: Provide comprehensive metrics for integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Develop a plugin system to allow users to extend broker functionality with custom modules, such as data processing, integration with various databases, or forwarding messages to platforms like Kafka.
- **MQTT-SN Support**: Add support for MQTT-SN protocol for constrained IoT devices.
